# PPTX Reader Feature Completeness Checklist

A structured inventory of PPTX reader and renderer capabilities, organized by feature domain. Tracks progress toward Walnut-like presentation rendering and identifies gaps.

## Overview

**Completeness**: ~50% (per-run text + master inheritance shipped; theme colors and tables next)

**Key Status**:
- ✅ Core slide structure and basic shape rendering
- ✅ Text, tables, grouped shapes, connectors (basic)
- ✅ Charts and basic chart types
- ✅ Thumbnail generation and slideshow mode
- ✅ Per-run text rendering (DirectTextParagraph[]/DirectTextRun[] — mixed colors/sizes/weights per element)
- ✅ Master slide inheritance with 3-tier placeholder dedup (master→layout→slide)
- ⏳ Theme color resolution (scheme/accent colors not yet resolved in render layer)
- ⏳ Tables in slides (reader 90% complete; render layer not yet consuming)
- ⏳ SmartArt/diagrams and complex nested shapes
- ⏳ Advanced effects, cropping, and masks
- ⏳ Presentation interaction (navigation, timing, transitions)

## Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
1. ✅ Core slide structure and basic shapes
2. ✅ Text rendering and basic styling
3. ✅ Tables and basic table rendering
4. ✅ Charts (basic types and series)
5. ✅ Thumbnail and slideshow UI

### Phase 2: Theme & Master Inheritance (In Progress)
1. ✅ Master slide decoding + 3-tier placeholder dedup (slide > layout > master)
2. ✅ Per-run text rendering (DirectTextParagraph[]/DirectTextRun[]) in both SVG thumbnails and HTML canvas
3. Theme color scheme resolution: map scheme color refs (accent1-6, dk1/dk2, lt1/lt2) → RGB via decoded theme palette
4. Complete layout-specific placeholder overrides (text style cascading from master/layout runs)
5. Add multiple master slide support and fallback resolution
6. Implement list-level defaults from master/layout

### Phase 3: Visual Fidelity (Medium Priority)
1. SmartArt and diagram support
2. Complex shape transforms and 3D shapes
3. Advanced image effects (crop, masks, duotone, artistic filters)
4. Connector dynamic routing
5. Glow, soft-edge, and bevels effects

### Phase 4: Interaction (Lower Priority)
1. Slide timing and automatic advance
2. Presenter view (notes + slide)
3. Full animation engine
4. Slide navigation and custom shows
5. Accessibility features

---

### Phase 5: Media & Video (Enabled by SDK 3.4.1)
1. MP4 video extraction and thumbnail display
2. Embedded audio playback
3. Linked media handling and fallback

## Open XML SDK Version Notes

The WASM reader was updated from `DocumentFormat.OpenXml 3.3.0` to `3.4.1` (2026-01-06). Key gains for PPTX:

| Change | Impact on PPTX |
|--------|----------------|
| `MediaDataPartType.Mp4` added | MP4 video in presentations now accessible at part level |
| Q3 2025 Office schemas bundled | New PowerPoint 2025 features accessible (animations, layout, effects) |
| WASM JIT/AOT size reduction | Smaller presentation reader bundle in browser |
| New PowerPoint namespaces from prior releases | `Y2023.M02.Main`, `Y2022.M03.Main` unlocked from v3.0.0 |
