# Kanban ACP sessions do not support browser-embedded interactive terminal control

## What Happened

The `/workspace/[workspaceId]/kanban` experience can open ACP sessions inside the board UI, but the session area is still a chat-centric panel. Terminal output from ACP agent operations can already be rendered in xterm.js, yet the web UI does not provide a way to enable a real interactive terminal and send keyboard input back into a running shell from the browser.

## Expected Behavior

Kanban should be able to offer an explicit browser-side interactive terminal mode for ACP sessions when the provider and runtime support it, so users can inspect or continue work directly in the same modal/panel instead of switching to a separate session page or desktop-only PTY flow.

## Reproduction Context

- Environment: web
- Trigger:
  1. Open `/workspace/<workspaceId>/kanban`
  2. Start or open an ACP session from a Kanban card or the KanbanTask Agent panel
  3. Observe that the session UI embeds `ChatPanel`
  4. Observe that terminal rendering is output-only and there is no browser control path for shell stdin

## Why This Might Happen

- The Kanban UI currently reuses the existing session `ChatPanel` and does not define a terminal-first interaction mode.
- The web terminal renderer is intentionally read-only, while the only interactive terminal component is tied to desktop PTY commands.
- ACP terminal support on the server is designed for agent-initiated terminal lifecycles (`terminal/create`, `terminal/output`, `terminal/wait_for_exit`, `terminal/kill`, `terminal/release`) rather than user-driven shell input.
- The browser ACP client and `/api/acp` route expose prompt and cancellation flows, but not a dedicated browser-to-terminal input API.

## Relevant Files

- `src/app/workspace/[workspaceId]/kanban/kanban-page-client.tsx`
- `src/app/workspace/[workspaceId]/kanban/kanban-tab.tsx`
- `src/client/hooks/use-acp.ts`
- `src/client/acp-client.ts`
- `src/client/components/message-bubble.tsx`
- `src/client/components/terminal/terminal-bubble.tsx`
- `src/client/components/terminal/pty-terminal.tsx`
- `src/core/acp/acp-process.ts`
- `src/core/acp/terminal-manager.ts`
- `src/app/api/acp/route.ts`

## Observations

- `kanban-page-client.tsx` creates ACP sessions and immediately sends prompts, which makes Kanban session launch path straightforward but chat-oriented.
- `kanban-tab.tsx` renders ACP sessions in-place through `ChatPanel` both for the KanbanTask Agent side panel and the task detail modal.
- `terminal-bubble.tsx` already uses xterm.js, but sets `disableStdin: true`, so browser users cannot type into it.
- `pty-terminal.tsx` is interactive, but only for Tauri and only through desktop bridge commands such as `pty_create` and `pty_write`.
- `terminal-manager.ts` already manages long-lived server-side shell processes and streams output over ACP `session/update`, so part of the backend foundation exists.
- `/api/acp` currently handles `session/new`, `session/prompt`, `session/respond_user_input`, and `session/cancel`, but not a user-facing terminal input channel for browser sessions.
