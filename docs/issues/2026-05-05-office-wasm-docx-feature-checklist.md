# DOCX Reader Feature Completeness Checklist

A structured inventory of DOCX reader and renderer capabilities, organized by feature domain. This tracker focuses on production-readiness gaps identified by Walnut protocol parity work.

## Overview

**Completeness**: ~90% (protocol nearly feature-complete; rendering/visual fidelity is the next frontier)

**Key Status**:
- ✅ Protocol equivalence locked against Walnut for all committed fixtures + real-world Chinese samples
- ✅ Core rendering (text/styles/tables/images/headers/footers/sections) production-ready
- ⏳ Visual layout depth (floating object ordering/wrap distance/effects) and chart payload long-tail next
- ⏳ Long-tail edge cases (rare style/table/header combinations)

## Feature Domains

### 1. Core Protocol & Reading

**Status**: 100% complete

- [x] Document structure (body, sections, headers/footers)
- [x] Paragraph styles with `basedOn` chains and inheritance
- [x] Run styles (font, size, bold, italic, underline, color, highlight, scheme)
- [x] Table structure (rows, columns, spans, merges, nesting)
- [x] Lists and numbering (bullets, auto-numbers, list levels)
- [x] Hyperlinks and bookmarks
- [x] Content controls (text, rich text, dropdown, date picker)

## Recommended Next Steps

### High-Priority (blocks preview surface)
1. **Floating wrap & effects** — Complete image/shape positioning and visual effects for realistic document rendering
2. **Chart payload rendering** — Move from references to actual chart visualization
3. **Broader real-world fixtures** — Test against larger production corpus to uncover missing edge cases

### Medium-Priority (polish)
4. **Field codes** — Expand beyond basic page numbers to date/time/cross-references
5. **Outline/TOC** — Interactive table of contents generation
6. **Advanced table styling** — Banded rows, conditional styling, merge patterns

### Lower-Priority (long-tail)
7. **Group objects and connectors** — Rare drawing features
8. **Advanced shape effects** — Shadows, 3D, reflections (visual only)
9. **Revision UI** — Accept/reject change interface
